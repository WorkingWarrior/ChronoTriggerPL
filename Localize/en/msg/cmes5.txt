FLD_CMES5_000,The range of effect varies between techs.
FLD_CMES5_001,Some techs affect an area surrounding the target,\dealing damage to all enemies in the vicinity.
FLD_CMES5_002,For example, target this little beastie...
FLD_CMES5_003,...and your attack will hit the neighboring\monster as well, since it is within range.
FLD_CMES5_004,But if you target this one in the center...
FLD_CMES5_005,...you can hit all three at once!\Use the tech's reach to your advantage.
FLD_CMES5_006,Next, there are techs that hit enemies along\a straight line.
FLD_CMES5_007,These types of techs come in two varieties.\Let's take a look at the first one.
FLD_CMES5_008,This type of tech allows you to attack all the\enemies located on a straight line extending\from you and passing through your target.\In this case, it would strike three enemies.
FLD_CMES5_009,You could target any one of the enemies along\the line and the effect would be the same.
FLD_CMES5_010,Now let's see the other variety.
FLD_CMES5_011,A tech like this only allows you to hit enemies\along the line that connects you and your target.
FLD_CMES5_012,If you target the farthest enemy, you can still\deal damage to all three.
FLD_CMES5_013,But select this one, and that's all you'll get!
FLD_CMES5_014,A third type of tech strikes all enemies along\a horizontal line passing through your target.
FLD_CMES5_015,All that matters is that your enemies form a line.
FLD_CMES5_016,The final pattern puts you at the center of the\attack zone.
FLD_CMES5_017,You can't use an attack like this if there are\no enemies within range.
FLD_CMES5_018,But if you find yourself surrounded, using one\of these techs will allow you to deal damage to\all of the enemies in the circle around you.
FLD_CMES5_019,As long as they do, targeting any of them\will have the same effect.
FLD_CMES5_020,Queen: I know what you have seen.\It is your futures that slumber in this hall.\Destiny, in its essential form.<PAGE>\All the dreams that might have been.\All the happiness, and sorrow, you might have known.\Your tomorrow, as it has been witnessed.
FLD_CMES5_021,Queen: The Black Omen transcends time and space,\drifting through the all and nothing, waiting\for Lavos to awaken.<PAGE>\Destiny has led you here, and here you shall remain.\Unless you can defeat me and bring down the Omen,\there is no future for you!
FLD_CMES5_022,Queen: Come, children! Lavos slumbers. \I will guide you into the depths of his dream.<PAGE>\Did I say dream? I meant, of course, his eternal\nightmare!
FLD_CMES5_023,Queen: Argh! My powers don't seem to work here!<PAGE>\Ah, but I've a better idea! I can feed you to the\Mammon Machine!<PAGE>\You'll be made one with the Omen, Lavosâ€”and me!
FLD_CMES5_024,<CT>\Obtained Moon Stone!
FLD_CMES5_025,<NAME_LUC>: This is the ancient Sun Stone?\It looks like it's been drained of all its energy.
FLD_CMES5_026,We could probably recharge it with sunlight,\but that would take aeons.
FLD_CMES5_027,<NAME_ROB>: This is the Sun Stone of antiquity?\It appears to have lost the light it once possessed.
FLD_CMES5_028,However, it may be possible to recharge it by exposing\it to sunlight for a long enough period of time. By my\best estimate, it would require a minimum of 65 million\years of constant exposure.
FLD_CMES5_029,<NAME_MAG>: So this is the Sun Stone.\Its power has been lost over these long years.
FLD_CMES5_030,With the sun's energy, it could likely be renewed.<PAGE>\But that would take at least 65 million years.
FLD_CMES5_031,<NAME_MAR>: Is this the Sun Stone?\There's no light left in it.
FLD_CMES5_032,Maybe if we let it bask in constant sunlight again,\it will get its glow back. Might take a while, though.
FLD_CMES5_033,<NAME_FRO>: Is this the Sun Stone of old?\Its flame has long since faded, I fear.
FLD_CMES5_034,Mayhap the sun could rekindle it, given time to do\its work. But how many long years would that require?
FLD_CMES5_035,That girl <NAME_LUC> was over in the square going on\about how she'd made the discovery of a lifetime.
FLD_CMES5_036,Heh heh...\A man's never too old to collect Silver Points!
FLD_CMES5_037,Hmm... I was looking forward to the King's\parade, but it still hasn't gotten underway.\I wonder if something's wrong?
FLD_CMES5_038,Something tells me I'm as happy now as I'll ever be.
