FLD_EXMS3_004,<NAME_LUC>: It looks like we've come to the world of\some other age.
FLD_EXMS3_005,<NAME_ROB>: I am unfamiliar with this location.

FLD_EXMS3_008,<NAME_LUC>: It looks like we've come to the world of\some other age.
FLD_EXMS3_009,<NAME_FRO>: It seems almost a confluence of sorts, as\if time's streams were crossed.
FLD_EXMS3_010,<NAME_MAR>: Is space all twisted here?\I don't understand.
FLD_EXMS3_011,<NAME_FRO>: In any case, shall we explore?
FLD_EXMS3_012,<NAME_LUC>: I don't really like this, but should we take\a look at what's here?\
FLD_EXMS3_013,<NAME_ROB>: Shall we explore?\I find this place intriguing already.
