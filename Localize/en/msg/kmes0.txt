FLD_KMES0_005,Chancellor: His execution is three days hence.\See that he is still here to attend it.
FLD_KMES0_006,Warden: Yes, sir!
FLD_KMES0_007,Warden: Execution?\I don't recall hearing anything about that.
FLD_KMES0_008,Chancellor: No cause for concern, there's\only been a small delay in the paperwork.\Or do you mean to question me?

FLD_KMES0_051,Oh, I do love me a good fair!\Time to forget my troubles with a few mugs of mirth!
FLD_KMES0_052,The Fiendlord's army laid waste to this bridge.\We are working to repair it, but until Sir Cyrus returns,\we must see to the kingdom's defense as well.
FLD_KMES0_053,That damnable frog swam to the other side.
FLD_KMES0_054,We've no more foodstuffs.
FLD_KMES0_055,Now, if we can but put the Fiendlord's army to rout...
FLD_KMES0_056,Commander: Our provisions are depleted.\Have the supplies still not arrived from the castle?\We'll starve at this rate.
FLD_KMES0_057,We sent our order's finest knights to march on the\enemy in order to ensure the Hero's safe passage.
FLD_KMES0_058,It appears our men and the Fiendlord's are locked in\battle upon the bridge. May we emerge victorious!
FLD_KMES0_059,Could the Hero alone truly have the power to\defeat an army of fiends?
FLD_KMES0_060,Would that our strength were enough to best the\Fiendlord's army. But alas, our only hope lies with\the Hero.
FLD_KMES0_061,I'd thought those stories of the Hero who would\come bearing the Badge no more than bedtime tales.\But now he's come, and there's little to do but\trust in him.
FLD_KMES0_062,Commander: The Fiendlord has sent in reinforcements.\It's far too dangerous to allow you through.
FLD_KMES0_063,Commander: Lord <NAME_CRO>! What word?<PAGE>\Give him the food?\<S10><S10><C1>Yes.</C1>\<S10><S10><C2>No.</C2>

FLD_KMES0_065,Commander: Lord <NAME_CRO>, if I should not return\alive...give my brother my thanks.
FLD_KMES0_066,Commander: What's happened?
FLD_KMES0_067,<NAME_MAG>'s troops have launched their attack!\Our defenses will not hold!
FLD_KMES0_068,Commander: You are knights of Guardia!\Defend the honor of our order, and drive\the enemy back whence it came!
FLD_KMES0_069,But, we are far outnumbered!
FLD_KMES0_070,Commander: This is our last line of defense.\It must not break!
FLD_KMES0_071,Very well, my lord!
FLD_KMES0_072,Ugh...
FLD_KMES0_073,The Hero reached the far bank, but our men\suffered heavy losses in the crossing.
FLD_KMES0_074,It seems mere men haven't the strength to stop\these fiends.
FLD_KMES0_075,Commander: As you can see, Lord <NAME_CRO>, it's all\my men can do to hold this line.<PAGE>\Might you lend your blade to our battle as well?\<S10><S10><C1>Yes.</C1>\<S10><S10><C2>No.</C2>
FLD_KMES0_076,Commander: You have my most profound gratitude.\The Fiendlord's troops are positioned just beyond\the bridge.<PAGE>\Take this with you.\May it keep you safe!
FLD_KMES0_077,Commander: <NAME_MAG>'s army is a force to be\reckoned with. Please be on your guard.
FLD_KMES0_078,Commander: I see...\But we, too, are knights of Guardia.\We shall hold this position to the last man!
FLD_KMES0_079,Commander: Thanks to your aid, we were able to\defend the bridge. But unless we defeat <NAME_MAG>,\it is an empty victory.
FLD_KMES0_080,We could not have regained the bridge without you.
FLD_KMES0_081,Now that <NAME_MAG> no longer leads his troops,\they are not enemies in the eyes of Guardia.
FLD_KMES0_082,When <NAME_MAG> left, his troops deserted.
FLD_KMES0_083,<NAME_MAR>: Wait up, already!
FLD_KMES0_084,<NAME_LUC>: He's pretty quick when it comes\to running away.

FLD_KMES0_094,<NAME_LUC>: Sore loser, aren't you?
FLD_KMES0_095,<NAME_ROB>: You cannot win.\Surrender at once.
FLD_KMES0_096,Ozzie: Go, Zombor!\Crush Lord <NAME_MAG>'s enemies!
FLD_KMES0_097,Cyrus: Glenn...\I've decided to join the knighthood.
FLD_KMES0_098,Glenn: I thought as much.\You'll be a fine knight, I'm sure of it.
FLD_KMES0_099,Cyrus: Won't you come with me?
FLD_KMES0_100,Glenn: I...I cannot.
FLD_KMES0_101,Cyrus: But, why?\You're a better sword than I, you always have been.
FLD_KMES0_102,Glenn: I haven't the nerve it takes to be a knight.\In a real battle, the fear would take me.
FLD_KMES0_103,Melchior: Oh, you've come to see me!\Well, by all means, have a look at my collection.<PAGE>\Could I interest you in a weapon?\I'll give you a special price.\<S10><S10><C1>Yes, I'd like to buy one.</C1>\<S10><S10><C2>No, I'm not interested.</C2>
FLD_KMES0_104,Melchior: Weapons are not meant for the taking\of lives. They're meant for saving them.
FLD_KMES0_105,Melchior: Well, you know where to find me\should the need arise.
FLD_KMES0_106,Melchior: That sword is a masterwork.\Lightweight, and perfectly balanced.\Forged by yours truly, of course.
FLD_KMES0_107,Melchior: Oh, if you're wanting to return\to Truce, there's a shortcut through the\cave in the mountains to the north.

FLD_KMES0_112,<NAME_MAR>: Hmm?\It looks like Melchior isn't home!
FLD_KMES0_113,<NAME_MAR>: I wonder what this is?\Let's see here...
FLD_KMES0_114,<NAME_MAR>: What!? He's gone when we need him\the most!
FLD_KMES0_115,Melchior: Oh, you're back again!\Come to see my collec—
FLD_KMES0_116,Melchior: Th-this sword, it's...the Masamune!\How...how did you get this?
FLD_KMES0_117,<NAME_MAR>: Why is your name on that sword?
FLD_KMES0_118,<NAME_LUC>: Why would your name be engraved\on that sword?
FLD_KMES0_119,Melchior: ...<PAGE>\That...is a very long story.
FLD_KMES0_120,Melchior: But that is the story you came to hear,\is it not?
FLD_KMES0_121,<NAME_MAR>: Yes! Tell us about the Masamune!
FLD_KMES0_122,<NAME_LUC>: Of course! Tell us about the Masamune!
FLD_KMES0_123,<NAME_MAR>: Is there any way you can fix it?
FLD_KMES0_124,<NAME_LUC>: Can you reforge it?
FLD_KMES0_125,Melchior: I could—were it possible for us to get\our hands on some of the dreamstone from which\the sword was made.
FLD_KMES0_126,<NAME_MAR>: Dreamstone?\Where can we get that?
FLD_KMES0_127,<NAME_ROB>: Dreamstone...\No record of such a substance exists in my\memory banks.
FLD_KMES0_128,Melchior: It's nowhere to be found anymore.\It was a glittering red stone, once valued even\more than gold.<PAGE>\Unfortunately, that was long, long ago.\Longer even than you could imagine...
FLD_KMES0_129,Melchior: Well, let us just say I doubt you'll ever\find any. But if you should, I'll be more than happy\to repair the Masamune. Keep it with you until then.<PAGE>\So, would you like to buy anything?\<S10><S10><C1>Yes.</C1>\<S10><S10><C2>No.</C2>
FLD_KMES0_130,Melchior: Dear me, you truly found dreamstone!\Yes, that will do quite nicely. With that, I can\make the blade whole again.
FLD_KMES0_131,Melchior: But first the Masamune, and now this\dreamstone... How in the world did you—?
FLD_KMES0_132,Melchior: No, I suppose it does not matter.\Make yourselves at home! This will take some time.
FLD_KMES0_133,<NAME_LUC>: I'll lend you a hand!
FLD_KMES0_134,<NAME_ROB>: I will assist you.
FLD_KMES0_135,Melchior: Behold!\The Masamune, in all its glory!
FLD_KMES0_136,<NAME_MAR>: Wow!\That's the same sword we gave you?
FLD_KMES0_137,<NAME_ROB>: How peculiar.\My sensors are detecting pulses of mental\energy emanating from the Masamune.
FLD_KMES0_138,Melchior: A sword can be used as a tool for\ending lives or as one for saving them. It\all depends on the one who wields it. Be sure\you wield yours for the proper reason.<PAGE>\Would you like to buy something?\<S10><S10><C1>Yes.</C1>\<S10><S10><C2>No.</C2>
FLD_KMES0_139,<NAME_MAR>: <NAME_CRO>, where are you going?\The Masamune isn't fixed yet!
FLD_KMES0_140,<NAME_LUC>: Hey, <NAME_CRO>! You're not just\gonna leave the Masamune here, are you?
FLD_KMES0_141,<NAME_ROB>: Sir <NAME_CRO>, the Masamune has not\yet been fully repaired.
FLD_KMES0_142,Melchior: All right, then...
FLD_KMES0_143,<NAME_LUC>: How are you going to fix it?
FLD_KMES0_144,<NAME_ROB>: It looks like it will be quite difficult to\repair.
FLD_KMES0_145,Melchior: Do not interrupt me while I'm trying to read!
FLD_KMES0_146,Melchior: You just leave this to me.
FLD_KMES0_147,Melchior: Of course, the dreamstone must be\refined if we are to repair the Masamune.\But that is not all. The blade itself must\be activated as well.<PAGE>\You work on the dreamstone.\I will take care of the sword.
FLD_KMES0_148,<NAME_LUC>: Okay!\Fear not, the great <NAME_LUC> knows her way\around a workshop!
FLD_KMES0_149,<NAME_ROB>: Understood.
FLD_KMES0_150,<NAME_LUC>: Well, better get busy!
FLD_KMES0_151,<NAME_ROB>: I will prepare the tools.
FLD_KMES0_152,<NAME_LUC>: This's pretty complicated.\Think you could go somewhere else for a while?\You're ruining my concentration.
FLD_KMES0_153,<NAME_ROB>: Refining this dreamstone without the\proper equipment could take a significant amount\of time.
FLD_KMES0_154,Melchior: To reawaken the sword, I must first\breathe life back into its shattered remains.
FLD_KMES0_155,Melchior: The spell to restore life to the\blade requires immense concentration.\Could you refrain from interrupting me?
FLD_KMES0_156,Melchior: All right, it's done!\Could you bring me the dreamstone?
FLD_KMES0_157,<NAME_LUC>: I'm done here, too.
FLD_KMES0_158,Melchior: All right, let's get started.
FLD_KMES0_159,Melchior: Sorry to keep you waiting.
FLD_KMES0_160,Melchior: If you were expecting lesser work,\you shouldn't have come to me!
FLD_KMES0_161,<NAME_MAR>: Okay, <NAME_CRO>, let's take the\Masamune to <NAME_FRO>!
FLD_KMES0_162,<NAME_ROB>: <NAME_CRO>, let us take the Masamune\to <NAME_FRO>.
FLD_KMES0_163,<NAME_LUC>: Okay, <NAME_CRO>, we should get this\back to <NAME_FRO>!
FLD_KMES0_164,<NAME_LUC>: So this is the Masamune...\It's producing some kind of strange energy.\If I could only study it for a little while...
FLD_KMES0_165,You folks came out of my wardrobe, didn't you?\What are you doing in here?
FLD_KMES0_166,Why is there magic in you?\Magic-using humans were supposed to have died\out long ago.\
FLD_KMES0_167,Who do you think you are, coming and going from\someone else's wardrobe at all hours of night and\day? Humans... I'll tell you!
FLD_KMES0_168,Medina is a village of fiends, founded by our\ancestors when they lost their war against\humankind 400 years ago. Most of the townsfolk\still have a grudge against humans, so be careful.

FLD_KMES0_171,Hey, hold on a minute.
FLD_KMES0_172,It's been 400 years since man warred against fiend.\There's no use living in the past. Of course, not\many other fiends seem to agree with that.
FLD_KMES0_173,There's an odd old human who lives near a cave in the\mountains to the west. He may be able to help you out.
FLD_KMES0_174,<NAME_MAR>: Thanks!
FLD_KMES0_175,<NAME_LUC>: Thanks a lot!\But aren't fiends supposed to hate humans?\Why are you being so helpful?
FLD_KMES0_176,<NAME_ROB>: Thank you for your advice.
FLD_KMES0_177,<NAME_ROB>: But why are you being so kind?\Do your people not despise humans?
FLD_KMES0_178,<NAME_MAR>: But why are you being so nice?\I thought fiends weren't supposed to get along\with humans.

FLD_KMES0_190,All right. I'll sell.
FLD_KMES0_191,Heh! You think I'm gonna charge a human the going\rate?
FLD_KMES0_192,<NAME_MAR>: <NAME_CRO>, what's that creepy chanting?
FLD_KMES0_193,<NAME_LUC>: That chanting's pretty creepy.\What do you make of it?
