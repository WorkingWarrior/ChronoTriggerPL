FLD_KMES2_008,<CT>\Here rests the brave Sir Cyrus,\whose spirit lives on in his true friend, Glenn.
FLD_KMES2_009,<NAME_ROB>: I am unable to damage it!
FLD_KMES2_010,<NAME_AYL>: Hard, like rock!
FLD_KMES2_011,<NAME_LUC>: It's too resilient!
FLD_KMES2_012,<NAME_FRO>: My sword is to no avail!
FLD_KMES2_013,<NAME_MAR>: Attacks just bounce right off it!
FLD_KMES2_014,<NAME_FRO>: Cyrus...
FLD_KMES2_015,<NAME_MAG>: ...
FLD_KMES2_016,<NAME_FRO>: Cyrus!?\'Tis I, Glenn!
FLD_KMES2_017,Ugh...<PAGE>\\Glenn...?
FLD_KMES2_018,<NAME_FRO>: Cyrus...<PAGE>\Cyrus, I have returned.<PAGE>\I will fulfill that oath I swore so long ago,\and my final promise to you as well.
FLD_KMES2_019,Cyrus: Glenn...<PAGE>\Thank you, for making the journey all this way.
FLD_KMES2_020,<NAME_FRO>: Cyrus...<PAGE>\You must think ill of me.
FLD_KMES2_021,Cyrus: Hah... You think overmuch.\You've come far, my friend.\I was never as fine a warrior as you are now.<PAGE>\As <NAME_MAG>'s fire consumed me, my heart burned\with the thoughts of all I'd left unfinished, and\all I left behind.<PAGE>\<NAME_MAG>...\King Guardia...\Queen Leene...<PAGE>\And of course you, my dear good friend.
FLD_KMES2_022,Cyrus: But the skills you've honed over all this time\are superior to any I could ever claim to know.<PAGE>\I can rest now, knowing that all will be made right by\your hands.<PAGE>\Farewell, my friend.
FLD_KMES2_023,<NAME_FRO>: Cyrus, wait!\I...<PAGE>\I...!
FLD_KMES2_024,Cyrus: The Queen...\Look after Queen Leene.<PAGE>\Farewell, Glenn...my friend.
FLD_KMES2_025,<NAME_FRO>: Cyrus!
FLD_KMES2_026,<NAME_FRO>: Forgive me, Cyrus.
FLD_KMES2_027,<NAME_FRO>: Hm?
FLD_KMES2_028,<NAME_FRO>: The...the Masamune!?
FLD_KMES2_029,<NAME_FRO>: It's pulsing with strength!
FLD_KMES2_030,Heh...<PAGE>\What else?
FLD_KMES2_031,Mune: All that emotional baggage was weighing\you down.<PAGE>\Masa: The Hero's strength is strength of will.<PAGE>\Mune: Can't very well save the world if you're\dwelling on the past!<PAGE>\Masa: Now you're truly strong!
FLD_KMES2_032,<NAME_FRO>: True strength...
FLD_KMES2_033,Mune: And now we can use all of our power, too!\Can't we, Masa?
FLD_KMES2_034,Masa: You bet, Mune!
FLD_KMES2_035,<NAME_FRO>: Ah!\The Masamune's true form!
FLD_KMES2_036,<NAME_FRO>: I must go now, Cyrus.<PAGE>\But I go to follow in your footsteps,\and see done all that you had wished.
FLD_KMES2_037,<NAME_FRO>: May my actions honor you!
FLD_KMES2_038,<NAME_FRO>: Come! Let us be on our way.
FLD_KMES2_039,There's an old structure to the north.\It's lain in ruin for centuries.
FLD_KMES2_040,The grave of the heroic knight Sir Cyrus lies to\the north. He fell in battle defending our kingdom\from <NAME_MAG>.
FLD_KMES2_041,Hm? You're thinking of visiting those ruins?\I'd stay away if I were you. They're quite dangerous,\what with all the structural damage underground.
FLD_KMES2_042,The tale of Sir Cyrus the Hero and his loyal\friend Glenn is an old one. It's been four\hundred years since Sir Cyrus fought <NAME_MAG>.
FLD_KMES2_043,They say ghosts lurk in the ruins to the north!
FLD_KMES2_044,Another dull day...\Maybe I should go to Guardia's Millennial Fair.
FLD_KMES2_045,Have you heard? Talk has it those ruins to the north\are haunted. Seems there's been ghost sightings!
FLD_KMES2_046,Oh, how dreadful!
FLD_KMES2_047,Spirits with lingering worldly attachments are drawn\to those sorts of places.
FLD_KMES2_048,It does get a bit boring when the world is\too peaceful, wouldn't you agree?
FLD_KMES2_049,The anguish of tormented spirits forms an almost\tangible cloud around the ruins to the north.
FLD_KMES2_050,Sir Cyrus, the patron of our town, rests in a\grave to the north.
FLD_KMES2_051,Toma's off in search of the Rainbow Shell, or\so he said before he left.
FLD_KMES2_052,The grave of the great explorer Toma is on the\western cape. Even he never managed to find the\treasure known as the Rainbow Shell.
FLD_KMES2_053,10 G for the night.\Will you be staying?\<S10><S10><C1>Yes.</C1>\<S10><S10><C2>No.</C2>
FLD_KMES2_054,You don't seem to have enough money.
FLD_KMES2_055,Welcome!
FLD_KMES2_056,Not a single sale yet!\And I came all the way from Porre.<PAGE>\Please, won't you buy something?
FLD_KMES2_057,All the young 'uns are off at that Millennial Fair.\Kids these days...they're just gluttons for fun.
FLD_KMES2_058,About ten years ago, a beast was seen dragging\something into the northern ruins. There was\talk it may have been some sort of treasure,\but no one knows for sure.
FLD_KMES2_059,There's something eerie about those ruins to the north.
FLD_KMES2_060,Sir Cyrus, a knight of Guardia, rests in a\grave to the north.
FLD_KMES2_061,Sir Cyrus's grave is just north of town.\You ought to go and pay your respects sometime.
FLD_KMES2_062,Have you heard?\About the ghost, I mean.\<S10><S10><C1>Yes.</C1>\<S10><S10><C2>No.</C2>
FLD_KMES2_063,Aw, I wanted to be the first to tell you!\Oh well.
FLD_KMES2_064,They say a ghostly knight haunts the northern ruins!<PAGE>\Scary, eh?\Sends chills down my spine just to think of it!
FLD_KMES2_065,Have you heard the tale of Sir Cyrus and his\loyal friend?\<S10><S10><C1>Yes.</C1>\<S10><S10><C2>No.</C2>
FLD_KMES2_066,Well, they say Sir Cyrus's best friend was a man\named Glenn.<PAGE>\Sir Cyrus, of course, was killed by <NAME_MAG>.\But this Glenn, he wasn't about to let that go\unpunished. He took up a legendary blade and\went straight off to avenge his friend.<PAGE>\Ahâ€”true friendship!
FLD_KMES2_067,Oh, Toma...\Would that you'd stay here but a little longer!
FLD_KMES2_068,Where must Toma's travels have taken him now?
FLD_KMES2_069,Bring me another mug!
FLD_KMES2_070,Barkeep: Sir, I think you've had quite enough already.
FLD_KMES2_071,Who're you to tell me when I've had enough?\You're worse than the wife! What's wrong with a\carpenter having a few pints in the afternoon, eh?
FLD_KMES2_072,Ah! So smooth and light upon the tongue...\I could drink this all day!
FLD_KMES2_073,Hm? You want to borrow my tools?<PAGE>\Well...sure, why not? Be my guest!\I'm a little busy, as you can see, so you'll\need to go and get them from my wife.
FLD_KMES2_074,Huh? When do I work if I'm in here doing this\all day? That's none of your concern!
FLD_KMES2_075,When I grow up, I'll be a carpenter just like my dad!
FLD_KMES2_076,All my husband does is sit at that tavern all day,\nursing drinks. Well, just wait till he comes home!\He'll be nursing a sore jaw then!
FLD_KMES2_077,What? His tools?\Oh, hold on, they're right here.
FLD_KMES2_078,Careful with those tools!
FLD_KMES2_079,Robbed of my carpentry tools...\How am I to work without my tools?
FLD_KMES2_080,Are those...are those carpentry tools you're carrying?<PAGE>\Might you be willing to lend them to me for a while?\<S10><S10><C1>Yes.</C1>\<S10><S10><C2>No.</C2>
FLD_KMES2_081,My thanks, friend.\Now I can finally get to work again!
FLD_KMES2_082,*sigh*\Oh, well...
FLD_KMES2_083,You've my thanks for lending me these tools.\'Twas most gracious of you. Now I can finally\get back to work!<PAGE>\All right! What say we start with the ruins up north?
FLD_KMES2_084,On your feet, you lazy do-naughts!<PAGE>\Whatever you say, Master!
FLD_KMES2_085,You want the northern ruins repaired?\2000 G ought to cover the cost.\<S10><S10><C1>Pay.</C1>\<S10><S10><C2>Don't pay.</C2>
FLD_KMES2_086,Beg pardons, friend. Labor and lumber don't\come for free.
FLD_KMES2_087,We can't repair monster-infested places.\Let us know when you've cleared a floor of beasties.\We'll handle the rest.
FLD_KMES2_088,There's nowhere left that we can repair.
FLD_KMES2_089,We've done all we can.
FLD_KMES2_090,We're only carpenter's apprentices.
FLD_KMES2_091,Our master's at the tavern.
FLD_KMES2_092,Toma: Ah, well met, <NAME_PT1>!\I've finally stumbled upon a hint as to the\whereabouts of the Rainbow Shell.<PAGE>\Still, I can't shake the feeling that things will go sour\this time. I fear my luck may have finally run out.\Say, would you mind holding on to this for me?
FLD_KMES2_093,Toma: Should the worst befall me, it would mean\a lot to me if you'd pour that over my headstone.<PAGE>\A touch morbid, I know, but...I beg you.
FLD_KMES2_094,<CT>Here Lies the Great Explorer\Toma Levine\Sixth of Thirdmoon, 634
FLD_KMES2_095,Toma: <NAME_PT1>! It's been many a day.<PAGE>\I located the Rainbow Shell, as it were.
FLD_KMES2_096,Toma: To the northwest of this cape is a large\island called the Giant's Claw. The Shell is there.
FLD_KMES2_097,Toma: But beware! There are droves of monsters\afoot there.
FLD_KMES2_098,Toma: Well, then, I believe this is farewell.
FLD_KMES2_099,Toma: Ah... There truly is no drink so fine as\one shared in the company of friends like you.<PAGE>\All the best to you!
FLD_KMES2_100,Toma: So, <NAME_PT1>, you beat me to the\Rainbow Shell?<PAGE>\No, I'm not upset. It's for the best, really.\No doubt I would only have ended up in the belly\of that beast.<PAGE>\All right. I suppose it's time I began searching\for the fabled Sun Stone, then!
FLD_KMES2_101,Toma XIII: Do you know of the legendary Sun Stone?<PAGE>\I discovered an ancient scroll that spoke of a\fearsome weapon that could be made by combining\a shard of the Stone with one of the Rainbow\Shell that the original Toma once sought.
FLD_KMES2_102,Fiona: My husband Marco hasn't returned from the war.<PAGE>\But we planted and tended these woods together,\so I mean to do my best to protect them until the\day he returns.
FLD_KMES2_103,Fiona: Much of this forest was destroyed in the\war against <NAME_MAG>. I toil endlessly to restore\it by replanting trees, but they all of them wither\and die.
FLD_KMES2_104,Fiona: Anything I plant dies before it even has a\chance to grow. It's the work of monsters lurking\out in that desert somewhere.
FLD_KMES2_105,Fiona: This young tree is one that has been cultivated\throughout the ages, mysteriously resilient, that could\surely restore this desert to a verdant land.<PAGE>\But I daren't plant so small a sapling out there now.\Not with all the monsters nesting in that cave.
FLD_KMES2_106,Fiona: My husband Marco is finally home from the war!<PAGE>\Oh, I'm so relieved!
FLD_KMES2_107,Marco: Worry not, my love.\We won't be parted again.
FLD_KMES2_108,Marco: The monsters in the desert cave fear water.\They seem vulnerable to it. But the greatest of\themâ€”water or no, I could not hope to slay that\beast on my own.
FLD_KMES2_109,Marco: You vanquished all the monsters?\However can we thank you?
FLD_KMES2_110,Marco: The monsters are defeated.\But our long battle to revive the\forest has only just begun.
FLD_KMES2_111,Fiona: Thank you for dealing with those foul creatures.\Now I can set to work replanting again.<PAGE>\Alas, I fear it will take ages to plant enough trees to\reforest this land.<PAGE>\Ah, if only there were someone who could toil for\centuries on end! Then these wastes could truly\be made green again.
FLD_KMES2_112,<NAME_ROB>: What do you think?<PAGE>\I could remain here and assist Madam Fiona, and\you could come to retrieve me here once my work\was complete.<PAGE>\Is that all right?\May I stay behind and help?\<S10><S10><C1>All right.</C1>\<S10><S10><C2>No.</C2>
FLD_KMES2_113,Fiona: With <NAME_ROB>'s help, my dream may well\come true. How can I ever thank you?
FLD_KMES2_114,This is Fiona's Shrine. Here we give thanks to Fiona\and <NAME_ROB> for reviving the forest scorched in the\war against <NAME_MAG> four hundred years ago.
FLD_KMES2_115,The remains of the venerable <NAME_ROB> are\enshrined in the inner sanctum.
FLD_KMES2_116,<NAME_ROB>: Systems reactivated.\Wh-where am I?
FLD_KMES2_117,<NAME_ROB>: Oh...<PAGE>\<NAME_PT1>, how nice to finally see you again!\Only a few moments may have passed for you,\but I have been waiting for four hundred years.<PAGE>\However, my efforts were worthwhile.\The forest is restored.<PAGE>\Now, shall we celebrate our four hundred-year\reunion?
FLD_KMES2_118,<NAME_MAR>: What was that?
FLD_KMES2_119,<NAME_LUC>: A tremor?
FLD_KMES2_120,<NAME_ROB>: A sudden earthquake, perhaps?
FLD_KMES2_121,<NAME_FRO>: Why does the ground tremble?
FLD_KMES2_122,<NAME_AYL>: Ground shake!
FLD_KMES2_123,<NAME_MAG>: ...?
FLD_KMES2_124,<NAME_MAR>: So that's the monster that killed all\the trees!
FLD_KMES2_125,<NAME_LUC>: That must be the monster responsible\for turning this place into a desert.
FLD_KMES2_126,<NAME_ROB>: The desertification here is likely\the result of that monster's presence.
FLD_KMES2_127,<NAME_FRO>: So, that fell beast is what changed soil to\sand!
FLD_KMES2_128,<NAME_AYL>: He make forest die!
FLD_KMES2_129,<NAME_MAG>: Melphyx...\So he's the one draining the life from this land.
FLD_KMES2_130,<NAME_MAR>: But if it can move through the earth,\it could come up...anywhere!
FLD_KMES2_131,<NAME_LUC>: It will be hard defeating a monster that\travels underground.
FLD_KMES2_132,<NAME_ROB>: But, engaging monsters capable of moving\through the earth is against all logical protocols!
FLD_KMES2_133,<NAME_FRO>: We must fight a foe that moves beneath\the earth? This will be no easy task!
FLD_KMES2_134,<NAME_AYL>: Bone, move under sand!\Hard see!
FLD_KMES2_135,<NAME_MAG>: Plaguesome creature...
FLD_KMES2_136,<NAME_MAR>: That should put a stop to the trees dying!\Fiona will be happy.
FLD_KMES2_137,<NAME_LUC>: Well, we've cleared out the source of\the desert's spread. We should go tell Fiona.
FLD_KMES2_138,<NAME_ROB>: We have neutralized the source of the\desertification. We should inform Madam Fiona.
FLD_KMES2_139,<NAME_FRO>: It is done. Let us tell Fiona.
FLD_KMES2_140,<NAME_AYL>: Bad bone smash.\Fiona, happy!
FLD_KMES2_141,<NAME_MAG>: Hmph.
FLD_KMES2_142,My hats are woven from twigs rich with the\mystical energies of the forest.
FLD_KMES2_143,We are made immortal!\We shall live forever with Lavos, who\feasts upon this planet from within.
FLD_KMES2_144,Now he rests, and gathers strength. But in a mere\14,000 years, he will emerge to rain destruction\upon the earth and crown himself its King!
FLD_KMES2_145,Now he rests, and gathers strength. But in a mere\1400 years, he will emerge to rain destruction upon\the earth and crown himself its King!
FLD_KMES2_146,Now he rests, and gathers strength. But in a mere\999 years, he will emerge to rain destruction upon\the earth and crown himself its King!
FLD_KMES2_147,Queen: Behold! The almighty Lavos reigns!
FLD_KMES2_148,The Black Omen is the path which leads to Lavos.\It is the conduit through which our limitless\power flows.<PAGE>\As long as the almighty Lavos reigns, your\dreams are all for naught!
FLD_KMES2_149,Sacrifice yourself to Lavos, and fulfill the\only purpose left to you! Mwa ha ha ha!
FLD_KMES2_150,Queen: Fools!\Have you not learned your lesson?
FLD_KMES2_151,Return to the <NAME_SIL>?\<S10><S10><C1>Yes.</C1>\<S10><S10><C2>No.</C2>
FLD_KMES2_152,Queen: You maggots...<PAGE>\I am the Queen who shall rule for all eternity at\Lavos's side. You will not stand in my way!
FLD_KMES2_153,<NAME_MAG>: You are deceived.\A pitiable plight...\One deserving of mercy, at least.
FLD_KMES2_154,<NAME_MAG>: I will put an end to all of this!
FLD_KMES2_155,Indulge in such arrogance in the next life!
FLD_KMES2_156,Queen: Mwa ha ha...<PAGE>\At last, Lavos stirs!<PAGE>\Before him, you are as grist before the wheel.\But, Iâ€”I shall attain immortality!
FLD_KMES2_157,Queen: Accursed prophet! Do not think I have\forgotten your transgression at the Ocean Palace.
FLD_KMES2_158,You shall pay for it now with your life!
FLD_KMES2_159,Queen: How dare you vermin hound my steps?
FLD_KMES2_160,Oh, almighty Lavos! Lend me your power!
FLD_KMES2_161,<NAME_MAG>: Fool. No thing, no life, can last forever.
FLD_KMES2_162,Pitiful creatures...\All of your struggling is for nothing.\The almighty Lavos has already drained\the life force from this planet.
FLD_KMES2_163,<CT>\It is firmly sealed.
FLD_KMES2_164,Ah, such fine weather!
FLD_KMES2_165,How the Black Omen shines in the sun!<PAGE>\Tomorrow should be a beautiful day as well.
