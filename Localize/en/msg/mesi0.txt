FLD_MESI0_006,<NAME_LUC>: Everything's completely rotten.\The refrigeration must have failed.
FLD_MESI0_007,<NAME_MAR>: <NAME_CRO>, look!<PAGE>\...<PAGE>\...<PAGE>\He's not breathing.\Must have died down here...
FLD_MESI0_008,<NAME_MAR>: There's something in his hand.\What do you suppose this is?
FLD_MESI0_009,<NAME_LUC>: It looks like some kind of seed.
FLD_MESI0_010,<NAME_MAR>: A seed?\Could it even grow in a place like this?
FLD_MESI0_011,A note is written on a soiled scrap of paper.<PAGE>\   That rat is more than just a statue!\   It knows the secret of this dome.\   Catch it!
FLD_MESI0_012,INITIATING COMMAND SEQUENCE...
FLD_MESI0_013,<NAME_MAR>: <NAME_CRO>!\What's that?
FLD_MESI0_014,<NAME_LUC>: <NAME_MAR>!<PAGE>\Let's smash this thing!
FLD_MESI0_015,Old Man: ...
FLD_MESI0_016,Old Man: No!<PAGE>\You mustn't go to Death Peak!<PAGE>\Wouldn't make it very far, anyway...\It has to be the right time, and...and it\has to be them, or...or the way is shut!\Yes, yes...
FLD_MESI0_017,Old Man: Schala... Oh, I've missed you so!
FLD_MESI0_018,Old Man: Say!<PAGE>\Have you seen my masterpieces?\The Ocean Palace and the Blackbird?\I designed and built them both, you know.\Fine works, wouldn't you say?
FLD_MESI0_019,Strange Construct: O Wise One, I cannot wait to\see what program code you will install in me next!<PAGE>\Old Man: Oh, now that's the sort of appreciation\that makes all my work worthwhile!<PAGE>\How's the current one?\Seems a little better than before, anyhow...
FLD_MESI0_020,Hmm?
FLD_MESI0_021,You who have opened the door...<PAGE>\I am Belthasar, the Guru of Reason,\and formerly of the kingdom of Zeal.\I was cast into this era by a great\disaster which befell our land.<PAGE>\Much to my surprise, I have learned that\the creature Lavos was not a product of\our age—far from it.<PAGE>\It seems that the being fell from the\sky in a bygone age, burrowing deep into\the planet's core. There he began to feed\upon its energy, growing ever stronger.
FLD_MESI0_022,Lavos's form was revealed briefly when he\was summoned forth by a mighty wizard by\the name of <NAME_MAG> in the year 600.<PAGE>\In the year 1999, Lavos emerged to claim\the surface.<PAGE>\Now he has taken the place I've named Death\Peak as his throne—or nest, as it may well be.\His miniature spawn now flow from the mountaintop,\an avalanche of death.<PAGE>\Lavos is a parasite—a parasite of gargantuan\proportions whose host is the planet itself.
FLD_MESI0_023,Trapped here, I endeavor to continue my study and\observation of Lavos. But I believe the end draws\near.<PAGE>\Maintaining one's sanity is an endeavor in and of\itself in an age such as this—an endeavor I fear\may be futile.<PAGE>\So before my mind is lost forever, I have decided to\leave these records of my knowledge behind, along\with my greatest invention.
FLD_MESI0_024,Ever did I long to return home, and toil endlessly\in search of a way. But as I neared the completion\of my research, so did I near the end of my days.<PAGE>\I have grown old, and frail. And so I leave it in\your hands—you, who have opened the way.<PAGE>\Take hold the reins of time, and let all the people\of this planet's past and future join as one!\Then—only then—you just may be able\to stop Lavos.
FLD_MESI0_025,You have little chance of success.\But even a little chance is still a chance! \You who have opened the door...the fate\of the world is in your hands.<PAGE>\Open now the final door, and claim what awaits you.\My last and greatest work...<PAGE>\The Wings of Time.
FLD_MESI0_026,<NAME_MAR>: Wow... This is amazing!<PAGE>\Which...which end do you suppose is the front?
FLD_MESI0_027,<NAME_LUC>: This must be Belthasar's invention.
FLD_MESI0_028,<NAME_ROB>: This must be the invention mentioned\in his recordings, the Wings of Time.
FLD_MESI0_029,<NAME_FRO>: This must be it—the Wings of Time!
FLD_MESI0_030,<NAME_AYL>: Oh!<PAGE>\What this thing?
FLD_MESI0_031,<CT>\A curious crest is engraved here,\and a mysterious force seals it shut.
FLD_MESI0_032,<CT>\The pendant begins to glow.
FLD_MESI0_033,Strange Construct: The final instruction\sequence the Wise One programmed into me\was for his burial.<PAGE>\Now I can join him in his eternal rest.<PAGE>\But first...<PAGE>\Hmm... I am certain there was one more\task I was ordered to complete.<PAGE>\Something about the seats...<PAGE>\...<PAGE>\...<PAGE>\...<PAGE>\Memory error. I forget.

FLD_MESI0_036,Strange Construct: Scared you, didn't I?<PAGE>\It's me...Belthasar!\I copied my memory into this thing.<PAGE>\What do you think? Precious, isn't he?<PAGE>\Anyway, there is something I need to explain.\Namely, how to transcend time!<PAGE>\Tap the Warp Button to display the Time Gauge,\then select the era you wish to visit.
FLD_MESI0_037,Belthasar: Ah, yes!
FLD_MESI0_038,Belthasar: Before you go, why don't you give\a name to my time machine?
FLD_MESI0_039,Belthasar: Well then, hop aboard!

FLD_MESI0_110,Strange Construct: I will now deliver a message\from the Wise One.
FLD_MESI0_111,Belthasar: Death Peak harbors a power capable\of restoring the slain to life.<PAGE>\But the power to reverse death is not one easily\invoked. The need must be great, and the person's\existence of the utmost importance.<PAGE>\And what's more, you'll need a double—a doll identical\to that person in every detail.<PAGE>\Then, and only then, will the power deign to hatch\the Egg.
FLD_MESI0_112,Belthasar: Yes... That will do quite well.<PAGE>\It seems the time has come for you to attempt\Death Peak. It is the only chance you have of\reviving your friend.<PAGE>\I've implanted one final program—truly, I mean\it this time—in this construct's memory banks.\It will help to guide you up the mountain.<PAGE>\Please stand back.
FLD_MESI0_113,Belthasar: Without the doppel doll, there is\no meaning in going to Death Peak. Go to the\place you have left it, and retrieve it with\all haste!
FLD_MESI0_114,Belthasar: A doppel doll! That would do nicely.\The magician Norstein Bekkler could whip one\up in the wink of an eye, if only he were here.<PAGE>\You've not heard of him, you say? Well, he loves\festivals. Find a fair, and there, too, you shall\almost certainly find Bekkler!

FLD_MESI0_130,Underling: Don't you have any bigger dream\in life, ribbit?
FLD_MESI0_131,Boss: My dream, huh, ribbit?<PAGE>\To be King of the Sewers! Yeah, ribbit!

FLD_MESI0_137,<NAME_MAR>: What?\It's over already?
FLD_MESI0_138,<NAME_LUC>: That is what "The End" usually means.
FLD_MESI0_139,<NAME_MAR>: But things were just starting to\get interesting!
FLD_MESI0_140,<NAME_LUC>: Well, let's see if we can get these\words out of the way, then.
FLD_MESI0_141,<NAME_MAR>: Yeah, take 'em away!\Then we can take a little trip down memory lane\and reflect on all the good times we had!
FLD_MESI0_142,<NAME_LUC>: Art director! Would you mind?
FLD_MESI0_143,<NAME_MAR>: First, let's take a closer look at\Leene Square!
FLD_MESI0_144,<NAME_LUC>: There's the Steel Runner.
FLD_MESI0_145,<NAME_MAR>: I just don't think I could go for\one like that. The armor would poke you all\the time.
FLD_MESI0_146,<NAME_LUC>: Forget that!\Can you imagine what the inside of\that armor must smell like?
FLD_MESI0_147,<NAME_MAR>: What a lovely thought, <NAME_LUC>.\Let's get on with the show, okay?
FLD_MESI0_148,<NAME_LUC>: Next up is your home, Guardia Castle. 
FLD_MESI0_149,<NAME_MAR>: Heh heh...\This one's a VERY nice memory!
FLD_MESI0_150,<NAME_LUC>: Is it ever! Whew!
FLD_MESI0_151,<NAME_MAR>: He was the only one you couldn't bring\yourself to shoot with your Zonker, wasn't he?\His name's Peter. He's not really a man, though.
FLD_MESI0_152,<NAME_LUC>: I...I knew that!
FLD_MESI0_153,<NAME_MAR>: Oh, it's Pierre!
FLD_MESI0_154,<NAME_LUC>: Wouldn't want anything to do\with someone like that. Obviously corrupt.\Someone ought to put him on trial!
FLD_MESI0_155,<NAME_MAR>: This next one just doesn't have\any spark. Where's the energy? That drive to\make the best of your situation? Cheer up!
FLD_MESI0_156,<NAME_LUC>: We might not be any better than\him if we were in his shoes.
FLD_MESI0_157,<NAME_MAR>: Well, good luck sowing that seed of yours!
FLD_MESI0_158,<NAME_LUC>: Theeeeere's Johnny!\Mr. Speed himself!

FLD_MESI0_161,<NAME_MAR>: Try again when you learn to ride, buddy!
FLD_MESI0_162,<NAME_LUC>: There's that stuffed-shirt, Cyrus!
FLD_MESI0_163,<NAME_MAR>: He is awfully handsome...
FLD_MESI0_164,<NAME_LUC>: But those clothes have got to go.
FLD_MESI0_165,<NAME_MAR>: Oh, and did you know he plucks his\eyebrows?
FLD_MESI0_166,<NAME_LUC>: Ugh, you've got to be joking!\Hmm... Still a hunk, though!
FLD_MESI0_167,<NAME_MAR>: Toma!\Now he's definitely my type!
FLD_MESI0_168,<NAME_LUC>: Aw, he's just a sot.
FLD_MESI0_169,<NAME_MAR>: Probably has dozens of girlfriends, too.
FLD_MESI0_170,<NAME_LUC>: Or boyfriends. Come to think of it, he\never really talked about his love life...
FLD_MESI0_171,<NAME_MAR>: What about him?\That Kino guy?
FLD_MESI0_172,<NAME_LUC>: Forget it.\Total Neanderthal!
FLD_MESI0_173,<NAME_MAR>: But the single-mindedness is kind of\cute, don't you think?
FLD_MESI0_174,<NAME_LUC>: He walks like a DUCK!
FLD_MESI0_175,<NAME_MAR>: He was a nice enough guy, though.
FLD_MESI0_176,<NAME_LUC>: Yeah, he meant well.
FLD_MESI0_177,<NAME_LUC>: <NAME_CRO>!
FLD_MESI0_178,<NAME_CRO>: This is your idea of a nice\little trip down memory lane?
FLD_MESI0_179,<NAME_MAR>: Heh heh!\I...I guess we got a little carried away!
FLD_MESI0_180,<NAME_LUC>: Say, what era should we go to now?
FLD_MESI0_181,<NAME_MAR>: One with lots of fun things to do!
FLD_MESI0_182,<NAME_CRO>: Now!
FLD_MESI0_183,<NAME_LUC>: Now, as in...the present?
FLD_MESI0_184,<NAME_MAR>: Okay!\The present it is!
