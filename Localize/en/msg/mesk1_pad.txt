FLD_MESK1_019,<NAME_MAR>: Let me through!
FLD_MESK1_020,I am sorry, my lady.\Not even you may enter.
FLD_MESK1_021,<NAME_MAR>: What are you talking about?\The Chancellor made up the entire thing!\There is no heirloom!\
FLD_MESK1_022,<NAME_MAR>: Aha!\The Rainbow Shell we gave to my ancestor four\hundred years ago must still be here.
FLD_MESK1_023,<NAME_MAR>: It's probably in the basement.\Let's go!
FLD_MESK1_024,<NAME_LUC>: If we can find the Rainbow Shell,\we'll be able to prove the King's innocence!
FLD_MESK1_025,<NAME_LUC>: Did you forget we changed history back\in 600 A.D.? The Rainbow Shell should still be in\the castle!
FLD_MESK1_026,<NAME_ROB>: The Rainbow Shell will prove the King's\innocence.
FLD_MESK1_027,<NAME_ROB>: Have you forgotten our actions in 600 A.D.?\We altered the course of history. The Rainbow Shell\should be here in the castle.
FLD_MESK1_028,<NAME_FRO>: Had we the Rainbow Shell, we could prove\his innocence.
FLD_MESK1_029,<NAME_FRO>: Have you forgotten? History is changed.\The shell should lie within this castle now.

FLD_MESK1_032,<NAME_MAG>: Would taking the Rainbow Shell to them\not resolve the issue?
FLD_MESK1_033,<NAME_MAG>: Are you such an absent-minded fool\you've forgotten what we did in 600 A.D. already?
FLD_MESK1_034,<NAME_MAR>: You really won't reconsider?<PAGE>\Soldier: No, Princess. I really won't.
FLD_MESK1_035,<NAME_MAR>: There is one other way.\It's a bit rough, but just follow me!

FLD_MESK1_037,Pierre? He's in the soldiers' quarters.

FLD_MESK1_043,<NAME_MAG>: There's a letter here.\Shall I burn it?
FLD_MESK1_044,<NAME_MAR>: To <NAME_MAR>...<PAGE>\Dearest <NAME_MAR>,\   I know things are not easy with your father.\But though it may be hard to realize now, know that\you will ever be his daughter.<PAGE>\Nothing can break the bonds of blood—neither\distance, nor words of anger. Someday you will leave\the nest and have children of your own. Then you will\understand the truth of what I say.<PAGE>\Blood is the sap that flows through the limbs of\a family tree. And come what may in future days,\we will forever be joined by that.\<S10><S10> -Queen Guardia XXI, Leene.
FLD_MESK1_045,<NAME_LUC>: Knows just what to say, doesn't she?<PAGE>\But we have more urgent things to think about!
FLD_MESK1_046,<NAME_ROB>: I have no parents or blood, so it is\difficult for me to comprehend the meaning.\But this letter seems somehow...warm.
FLD_MESK1_047,<NAME_FRO>: Queen Leene...<PAGE>\Time wastes. Let us finish what we came to do!
FLD_MESK1_048,<NAME_AYL>: Oh, leave nest!\<NAME_AYL> know leave nest!\Dactyl leave nest.\Time pass, get big, leave nest!<PAGE>\<NAME_MAR> leave nest, too?\Big change!

FLD_MESK1_089,<NAME_ROB>: Her methods do not appear logical.
FLD_MESK1_090,<NAME_FRO>: Hmm.
FLD_MESK1_091,Kino: Kino sorry.\All Kino's fault.
FLD_MESK1_092,<NAME_AYL>: It okay.\Kino take all Laruba person, run!

FLD_MESK1_101,<NAME_LUC>: So Lavos arrived all this time ago...
FLD_MESK1_102,<NAME_ROB>: It seems Lavos made his first appearance\here, and not in the year 600.
FLD_MESK1_103,<NAME_MAR>: So Lavos fell to the earth in this era.
FLD_MESK1_104,<NAME_FRO>: Lavos was not spawned by <NAME_MAG>.\It fell from the heavens—and so long ago!
FLD_MESK1_105,<NAME_AYL>: Lavos huge!\<NICK_CRO> fight that?
FLD_MESK1_106,<NAME_AYL>: <NICK_CRO>!\We go place Lavos fall!
FLD_MESK1_107,<NAME_LUC>: She's right, we may be able to do\something now! Let's go and see!
FLD_MESK1_108,<NAME_ROB>: Lavos should be weaker now.\We should go and see.
FLD_MESK1_109,<NAME_MAR>: He just arrived here. We might still\be able to do something. Let's go see!
FLD_MESK1_110,<NAME_FRO>: Left to its own devices, the creature will\burrow deep into the earth. Best defeat it now!
FLD_MESK1_111,<NAME_MAR>: There's a Gate!
FLD_MESK1_112,<NAME_LUC>: Why is there a Gate here?
FLD_MESK1_113,<NAME_ROB>: A Gate has formed!
FLD_MESK1_114,<NAME_FRO>: A Gate?
FLD_MESK1_115,<NAME_AYL>: Lavos fast!\Deep under earth now.
FLD_MESK1_116,<NAME_MAR>: This Gate was opened by Lavos.\He's probably the source of all the Gates.
FLD_MESK1_117,<NAME_LUC>: Now I understand!\The immense energy that Lavos gives off must be\stretching time and space. That's what's causing the\Gates!
FLD_MESK1_118,<NAME_ROB>: These Gates are likely the result of the\energy radiating from Lavos placing strains on the\surrounding time-space.
FLD_MESK1_119,<NAME_FRO>: Might Lavos be the source of these?<PAGE>\That one in <NAME_MAG>'s keep was immense.
FLD_MESK1_120,<NAME_AYL>: What wrong, <NICK_CRO>?\Want fight Lavos, go here. No?
FLD_MESK1_121,<NAME_MAR>: This is exciting!
FLD_MESK1_122,<NAME_LUC>: Yeah, it was the nearest Gate to Lavos\after all. I have no idea where we are.
FLD_MESK1_123,<NAME_ROB>: My time gyro reads...12,000 B.C.!\We are still in the very distant past.
FLD_MESK1_124,<NAME_FRO>: T-to where have we come?
FLD_MESK1_125,<NAME_AYL>: <NICK_CRO>! Where this place?
FLD_MESK1_126,<CT>\The way is sealed.
FLD_MESK1_127,Prophet: Hmm... So you came through here.
FLD_MESK1_128,Prophet: Now, Schala...\Once I throw them in, you will seal the portal shut.
FLD_MESK1_129,Schala: N-no!\You can't make me!
FLD_MESK1_130,Prophet: You will obey me.\Their lives are at stake.
FLD_MESK1_131,Schala: I... Very well.
FLD_MESK1_132,Schala: Please forgive me.
FLD_MESK1_133,<NAME_MAR>: Why did the prophet let us go?
FLD_MESK1_134,<NAME_LUC>: The prophet could have just as easily\killed us.
FLD_MESK1_135,<NAME_ROB>: Why would the prophet not eliminate us?
FLD_MESK1_136,<NAME_FRO>: He spared our lives, true enough.\But something is amiss.
FLD_MESK1_137,<NAME_LUC>: The key to defeating Lavos must lie\in that period.
FLD_MESK1_138,<NAME_ROB>: They were utilizing Lavos's power in\that era. The means to defeat him must be there.
FLD_MESK1_139,<NAME_FRO>: Where has <NAME_MAG> gone?\I will not allow him to escape until he has\answered for the past.
FLD_MESK1_140,<NAME_AYL>: They take Lavos power.\Lavos get weak?
FLD_MESK1_141,<NAME_MAR>: But we can't get back to that time.\What should we do?
FLD_MESK1_142,<NAME_LUC>: But the Gate to that time period has\been sealed off. I wonder if there's another way.
FLD_MESK1_143,<NAME_ROB>: But, the Gate has been sealed shut.
FLD_MESK1_144,<NAME_FRO>: Yet Schala has sealed the Gate,\and with it, it would seem, our fate.
FLD_MESK1_145,<NAME_AYL>: No Gate.\No can go.
FLD_MESK1_146,<NAME_MAR>: Wait a minute. The design from the door\that the pendant opened—I've seen it in other places.
FLD_MESK1_147,<NAME_LUC>: Wait! The crest on that sealed door...\We've seen it elsewhere, haven't we?
FLD_MESK1_148,<NAME_ROB>: Do you recall the crest on the door\that the pendant opened? I have seen several of\them in my own time.
FLD_MESK1_149,<NAME_FRO>: The emblem upon the door that pendant\opened... Had you not seen it in other ages before?
FLD_MESK1_150,<NAME_MAR>: Let's check it out, <NAME_CRO>!
FLD_MESK1_151,<NAME_LUC>: We may find our way back to that era yet!\Let's get cracking, <NAME_CRO>!
FLD_MESK1_152,<NAME_ROB>: Let us return to my time!
FLD_MESK1_153,<NAME_FRO>: It seems our only hope, does it not,\<NAME_CRO>?
FLD_MESK1_154,This is it—the summit of Death Peak.
FLD_MESK1_155,<NAME_MAR>: You who fear the night and stand against\the darkness...\Please, give us your strength!
FLD_MESK1_156,<NAME_LUC>: You who fear the night and fight the\coming of darkness...\Lend us strength!
FLD_MESK1_157,<NAME_ROB>: Fearer of night and opposer of darkness...\Please grant us your power.
FLD_MESK1_158,<NAME_FRO>: You who fear the night and stand\against the darkness—lend us your strength!
FLD_MESK1_159,<NAME_LUC>: <NAME_CRO>!
FLD_MESK1_160,<NAME_ROB>: <NAME_CRO>!
FLD_MESK1_161,<NAME_FRO>: <NAME_CRO>!
FLD_MESK1_162,<NAME_AYL>: <NICK_CRO>!
FLD_MESK1_163,The pendant's reacting!
FLD_MESK1_164,It...it shattered!
FLD_MESK1_165,<NAME_MAR>: But...\We've come so far!
FLD_MESK1_166,<NAME_MAR>: Please, answer me.\Don't leave me!
FLD_MESK1_167,<NAME_MAR>: <NAME_CRO>!
FLD_MESK1_168,<NAME_LUC>: No...\What use was it to come so far?
FLD_MESK1_169,<NAME_LUC>: <NAME_CRO>!\Say something!\Don't just ignore us!
FLD_MESK1_170,<NAME_FRO>: 'Twas folly to come here.\All this, and for naught...
FLD_MESK1_171,<NAME_FRO>: <NAME_CRO>!\Answer us!
FLD_MESK1_172,<NAME_ROB>: This cannot be!\All of our work accomplished nothing.
FLD_MESK1_173,<NAME_ROB>: <NAME_CRO>!\Please answer us!
FLD_MESK1_174,<NAME_LUC>: Try not to be upset.\It was silly to think we could get him back.
FLD_MESK1_175,<NAME_ROB>: Please do not despair.\We placed too much hope in bringing <NAME_CRO> back.
FLD_MESK1_176,<NAME_FRO>: Do not despair.\It was foolish to think we could cheat death.
FLD_MESK1_177,<NAME_AYL>: No cry!\<NAME_AYL> miss <NICK_CRO>, too.\Sad <NICK_CRO> no come back.
FLD_MESK1_178,<NAME_MAR>: <NAME_CRO>!\Oh, <NAME_CRO>, you're back!
