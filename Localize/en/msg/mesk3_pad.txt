FLD_MESK3_002,Lara: <NAME_LUC> and Taban are always off\tinkering on their latest inventions.
FLD_MESK3_003,Lara: What a beautiful day! I think I'll go\for a walk once I finish the housework.
FLD_MESK3_004,<NAME_LUC>: Hmm...\Reducing the form factor of a bipedal robot without\compromising balance is tougher than I thought.<PAGE>\Oh, <NAME_CRO>! Hurry up and escort the Princess\back to the castle!
FLD_MESK3_005,Taban: I bought you this apple with what we\earned today.
FLD_MESK3_006,Lara: Oh, you're so thoughtful.
FLD_MESK3_007,Taban: Oh! <NAME_LUC>'s friends!
FLD_MESK3_008,If you see <NAME_LUC>, tell her to drop by sometime.
FLD_MESK3_009,Taban: Hey, <NAME_LUC>!
FLD_MESK3_010,Taban: I've been working on some defensive gear for\my favorite daughter.
FLD_MESK3_011,Taban: Oh, perfect timing!
FLD_MESK3_012,Taban: Another great invention—just completed!\The ultimate in defense for my beautiful daughter!

FLD_MESK3_015,Lara: What is this thing, anyway?\Taban said to keep away from it, but it's so dusty.\Surely it wouldn't hurt just to tidy up a little.
FLD_MESK3_016,Lara: Dear me!\My skirt, it's—I'm stuck!\<NAME_LUC>!\<NAME_LUC>, help!

FLD_MESK3_067,King: I have no idea what you're talking about!\We have no ancient royal heirlooms here.
FLD_MESK3_068,Chancellor: Surely you don't intend to claim\this a forgery?<PAGE>\I ask you, good people of the court, why does\the defendant deny you a glimpse of this glorious\"Rainbow Shell"?<PAGE>\Why, because he no longer owns it.\He sold a priceless heirloom of our kingdom,\for no reason other than his own greed.\Witness, if you would please—
FLD_MESK3_069,Chancellor: P-Princess!\We are conducting a trial here.<PAGE>\<NAME_MAR>: Father!

FLD_MESK3_096,<NAME_MAR>: Father...\I...
FLD_MESK3_097,King: No, don't say it.\I was wrong to be so stubborn.
FLD_MESK3_098,<NAME_MAR>: No, I didn't even think about how you must\have felt.<PAGE>\I...\Oh, I know what I want to say, but the words just\won't come out.
FLD_MESK3_099,King: It's the same for me.\There was a time when I truly thought you\were lost to me.<PAGE>\But when I think about it now, I realize\that it was I who abandoned you.
FLD_MESK3_100,<NAME_MAR>: But I'm here now.\We'll talk about everything from now on.<PAGE>\I'll ask you for advice, and tell you about <NAME_CRO>,\and ask you about Mother, and...
FLD_MESK3_101,King: Ah, your mother...\Aliza...<PAGE>\I'm ashamed to admit it, but it's taken me until now to\understand what she meant with those final words.<PAGE>\"Someday, when Nadia is older, she'll bring someone\she loves to meet you. Welcome the two of them with\open arms."<PAGE>\She said that would make it a day you would remember\forever.
FLD_MESK3_102,<NAME_MAR>: You heard her last words?<PAGE>\King: Of course. You were so young you\probably don't remember.<PAGE>\You kept saying, "Daddy, I love lots of people!\Lots and lots!"<PAGE>\It reassured your mother, seeing you so happy.\She left us with a smile on her face.
FLD_MESK3_103,<NAME_MAR>: So that's how it was.<PAGE>\King: Yes, why?
FLD_MESK3_104,<NAME_MAR>: I used to call you Daddy?<PAGE>\King: You did.
