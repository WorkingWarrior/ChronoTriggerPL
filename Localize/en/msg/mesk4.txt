FLD_MESK4_006,Ken Narita: Love was in the air...but then\the engines cut out.\*sigh*

FLD_MESK4_018,Hey out there in TV land! How're we doing today?\It's me, Manabu Daishima! Let's all buy games, okay?\None of this renting and borrowing stuff!
FLD_MESK4_019,Shinichiro Okaniwa: I can't even remember the\last time I cut my hair. Look how long it is!\Better get myself to a barber.
FLD_MESK4_020,Good job! You reached the hardest ending!\This is the Chrono Trigger development room.\Take a walk around and hear what the team\has to say!<PAGE>\Keizo Kokubo: I hope you and all of the staff\who worked on the game took something from it\and will continue to grow and prosper, no matter\what the future holds in store.<PAGE>\Come back to see me again once you complete\your rounds.
FLD_MESK4_021,Well then, open the gates to the Dream Team!

FLD_MESK4_024,Fumi Nakashima: Did you see the little character\animations on the world map, ribbit? There's\Lucca reading a book, Chrono all in a rush...\Know what I'm talking about, ribbit?
FLD_MESK4_025,Yasuhiko Kamata: Having 32 megs means we can\use a lot of graphics. Using a lot of graphics\means we have to create a lot of graphics.\Well, it was hard work, but it sure was fun!
FLD_MESK4_026,Keita Eto: You want a buggy map repaired?\10,000,000 G ought to cover the cost.
FLD_MESK4_027,Haruyuki Nishida: Hey, do you think there\will be a sequel?\<S10><S10><C1>Yes.</C1>\<S10><S10><C2>No.</C2>

FLD_MESK4_053,Akihiko Matsui: What did you think?\I hope you had a good time!\See you in another game!
FLD_MESK4_054,Tetsuya Nomura: 3...<WAIT>08</WAIT>\2... <WAIT>08</WAIT>1...<WAIT>08</WAIT>\RESET!

FLD_MESK4_056,Yasuyuki Honne: This was my first project.\Whew, was I ever nervous!\What a relief it's over!
FLD_MESK4_057,Shinichiro Hamasaka: I just helped the Chrono\Trigger team a tiny bit. Good job, guys!
FLD_MESK4_058,Yoshinori Kitase: There are more than ten\different endings. Have you seen them all?\The ending you get depends on when you\challenge Lavos.
FLD_MESK4_059,Yusuke Naora: How was the art?\I had a blast working on it!
FLD_MESK4_060,Takayuki Ohtachi: Well done!
FLD_MESK4_061,Kezuka: Better find the switch soon or\it'll all go up in flames!
FLD_MESK4_062,<NAME_ROB>: I realized something during these\past four hundred years.<PAGE>\I believe we may have been incorrect in our\assumption that Lavos was responsible for the\creation of the Gates.
FLD_MESK4_063,<NAME_MAR>: What do you mean?
FLD_MESK4_064,<NAME_ROB>: It is not a certainty, but I have\come to believe it possible that some entity\wished for us to witness these events.<PAGE>\Perhaps it wanted us to see all of these\various ages. Alternately, it may have wished\to see them for itself.<PAGE>\It seems almost as though it was reflecting\on the days of its past.
FLD_MESK4_065,<NAME_AYL>: <NAME_AYL> know.\Person die, see life pass by.\Elder say!
FLD_MESK4_066,<NAME_FRO>: Before death claims a man, he is\made to bear witness a second time to those\memories engraved most deeply upon his heart.<PAGE>\There may be fond memories among them, yes.\But often as not, the ones which grieve us\are the most profound.
FLD_MESK4_067,<NAME_ROB>: Knowing the end is approaching\likely reactivates dormant feelings of regret,\and desire to return to moments in the past.
FLD_MESK4_068,<NAME_MAR>: Do you suppose that will happen when\our time comes?<PAGE>\<NAME_LUC>: Probably... Who knows?<PAGE>\<NAME_MAR>: Is there a point in time you'd want\to return to, <NAME_LUC>?
FLD_MESK4_069,<NAME_LUC>: I—no, not...not really.<PAGE>\<NAME_MAR>: I'm sorry, I probably shouldn't have asked.
FLD_MESK4_070,<NAME_LUC>: No, it's okay. It's just something I\don't like to think about too much.
FLD_MESK4_071,<NAME_FRO>: But even if Lavos did not open the\Gates, his fate is clearly bound to that of the\one who did.<PAGE>\Lavos has played a role in every age we've seen.
FLD_MESK4_072,<NAME_MAG>: Who do you think it is?
FLD_MESK4_073,<NAME_ROB>: It is unknown to me whose memories\these are. It is likely an entity greater than\any of us.<PAGE>\Perhaps we will not know until our journey has\come to an end.\<WAIT>08</WAIT>Shall we turn in for the night?
FLD_MESK4_074,<NAME_ROB>: You can give her my legs!\They are lightweight, with a highly compact\form factor and exceptional balance.<PAGE>\You could mount some treads on me instead.\Anything would be fine.
FLD_MESK4_075,<NAME_ROB>: Please do not be sad, <NAME_LUC>.
FLD_MESK4_076,<NAME_LUC>: Thank you.\You're such a good friend.
FLD_MESK4_077,<NAME_ROB>: A good...friend?\You called me your friend?\But...I am only a robot.
FLD_MESK4_078,<NAME_ROB>: That was always weighing on\your mind, was it not, <NAME_LUC>?\You are always thinking of others.
FLD_MESK4_079,<NAME_ROB>: I have a present for you.\It is a piece of amber I created using\sap from the trees in this forest.<PAGE>\It required four hundred years and a\great deal of pressurization to make.\I hope you will find it useful.
FLD_MESK4_080,<NAME_LUC>: <NAME_ROB>...\You're so sweet. Thank you.
