FLD_MEST1_002,<NAME_FRO>: This is it.
FLD_MEST1_003,<NAME_FRO>: The Fiendlord's keep!
FLD_MEST1_004,<NAME_FRO>: Ozzie!
FLD_MEST1_005,Ozzie: Welcome, Glenn! Or should I say, Sir Froggy?\Mwa ha ha! Never expected to see you here.\Are those your replacements for Cyrus?<PAGE>\Lord <NAME_MAG> is a tad busy right now.\You'll have to take up your business with me.<PAGE>\After you take it up with the master swordsman\Slash, and Flea, the magician, that is. Oh, right...
FLD_MEST1_006,Ozzie: And all 100 beasts in this keep, of course!
FLD_MEST1_007,Please, help us escape...
FLD_MEST1_008,From this eternal suffering!
FLD_MEST1_009,...
FLD_MEST1_010,Hee hee...
FLD_MEST1_011,Let's play.
FLD_MEST1_012,This is our treasure.
FLD_MEST1_013,Do you want our treasure?\<S10><S10><C1>Yes.</C1>\<S10><S10><C2>No.</C2>
FLD_MEST1_014,Really? It's good.
FLD_MEST1_015,Okay, but first...<PAGE>\Play with us! Please!\Pretty please!
FLD_MEST1_016,Hmm...<PAGE>\It seems you've freed my undying slaves.\Such insolence...\
FLD_MEST1_017,<NAME_FRO>: It has been ages, Slash.
FLD_MEST1_018,Slash: I must admit, I'd not even dreamed you\would find the courage to come here.<PAGE>\Had Cyrus not been with you the last time,\your fate would have been the same as all\the others.
FLD_MEST1_019,Slash: But I'm sure you'd have fit right in\with those skeletal servants of mine!
FLD_MEST1_020,Slash: You've some prowess.\For the first time in ages, perhaps\I'd best employ all of my own as well!
FLD_MEST1_021,Slash: And you, without Cyrus...
FLD_MEST1_022,Slash: You've no hope!
FLD_MEST1_023,Slash: Unbelievable!\But to fall fighting for Lord <NAME_MAG>...
FLD_MEST1_024,Slash: There could be no greater honor!
FLD_MEST1_025,<NAME_FRO>: The magician, Flea, I presume?
FLD_MEST1_026,<NAME_FRO>: That was not Flea.\Where is the true one?
FLD_MEST1_027,Tee hee hee...\I am here.\Right here...
FLD_MEST1_028,Greetings, little green one!
FLD_MEST1_029,<NAME_MAR>: What's with her?
FLD_MEST1_030,<NAME_LUC>: Who are you?
FLD_MEST1_031,<NAME_ROB>: Who is this person?
FLD_MEST1_032,<NAME_FRO>: She is a powerful magician.\Do not lower your guard!\Flea is not the mere woman she seems.
FLD_MEST1_033,Flea: Yes, yes...\I'm a man, after all, right?\*pout*
FLD_MEST1_034,<NAME_MAR>: That's a guy?
FLD_MEST1_035,<NAME_LUC>: Say what?\That's a guy!?
FLD_MEST1_036,<NAME_ROB>: But its exterior is clearly that of a female.
FLD_MEST1_037,Flea: Tee hee hee...\Man or woman, it's all the same.\Power is beauty, and I'm deliciously strong!
FLD_MEST1_038,Flea: Poor little Froggy!\You must be lonely now that Cyrus is gone.<PAGE>\And to be turned into something so hideous—how\dreadful!
FLD_MEST1_039,Flea: But since you've brought your new friends\over to play...
FLD_MEST1_040,Flea: Let me show you all a good time!
FLD_MEST1_041,Flea: But...but, I'm so beautiful!<PAGE>\Lord <NAME_MAG>...
FLD_MEST1_042,<NAME_CRO>! So this is where you've been since the fair.\You had me worried sick!
FLD_MEST1_043,You've been very naughty.<PAGE>\I think you'll have to die!
FLD_MEST1_044,Nadia...<PAGE>\Forgive me. I was wrong.\Please, return to the castle.
FLD_MEST1_045,That's where I'll bury you!
FLD_MEST1_046,Well, there you are, <NAME_LUC>!
FLD_MEST1_047,You're still alive?
FLD_MEST1_048,<NAME_ROB>, don't waste your energy.
FLD_MEST1_049,I'm only going to disassemble you anyway!
FLD_MEST1_050,<NAME_FRO>, you're safe!
FLD_MEST1_051,That will not do at all.
FLD_MEST1_052,Dance, dance!\The god of all fiends is born tonight!
FLD_MEST1_053,Ah!\The sacrifice has arrived!
FLD_MEST1_054,Even death does not stop your lust to kill one another.
FLD_MEST1_055,Such foolish creatures, you humans!
FLD_MEST1_056,Please, grant me death.
FLD_MEST1_057,Take my life.
FLD_MEST1_058,The torment...
FLD_MEST1_059,End this misery!
FLD_MEST1_060,Ozzie: So, you've made it.
FLD_MEST1_061,Ozzie: Flea!
FLD_MEST1_062,Ozzie: Slash!
FLD_MEST1_063,<NAME_FRO>: Pardons, Ozzie.\They cannot help you anymore.
FLD_MEST1_064,Ozzie: You fly-eating, tongue-flicking...
FLD_MEST1_065,Ozzie: Oz...<PAGE>\Ozzie's in a pickle!
FLD_MEST1_066,<NAME_FRO>: You'll not escape us!
FLD_MEST1_067,Ozzie: Welcome!
FLD_MEST1_068,Ozzie: Heh heh... Not bad.\How's this?
FLD_MEST1_069,Ozzie: *pant* *gasp* *wheeze*...
FLD_MEST1_070,Ozzie: What!?\Impossible!
FLD_MEST1_071,Ozzie: Doh!\You weren't supposed to make it this far!
FLD_MEST1_072,<NAME_FRO>: Ozzie...\Your time is nigh.
FLD_MEST1_073,Ozzie: Heh heh heh...<PAGE>\Lord <NAME_MAG> should have finished summoning Lavos\by now.
FLD_MEST1_074,Ozzie: I won't be defeated by you, I won't!\No attack can pierce my barrier!\I'm invincible!
FLD_MEST1_075,Ozzie: Gwah hah hah hah! Missed me!
FLD_MEST1_076,Ozzie: Where do you think you're aiming!?
FLD_MEST1_077,Ozzie: Mwee hee hee...
FLD_MEST1_078,Ozzie: Huh!?
FLD_MEST1_079,<NAME_MAR>: That was a breeze!
FLD_MEST1_080,<NAME_LUC>: What's that guy's problem?
FLD_MEST1_081,<NAME_ROB>: I wonder what affliction of the mind\that one must have been suffering from.
FLD_MEST1_082,<NAME_FRO>: Time is our enemy now.\We must hurry to <NAME_MAG>!
FLD_MEST1_083,Dal zumal phara-lo lierra...
FLD_MEST1_084,Cast open the gates that lie betwixt heaven and earth...
FLD_MEST1_085,In exchange for the life of this world...

FLD_MEST1_087,<NAME_MAG>: Ah, that frog of so many days ago.<PAGE>\How have you fared since last we met?
FLD_MEST1_088,<NAME_FRO>: Well enough. I owe you my gratitude.\This form has been a blessing in disguise.\Without it...
FLD_MEST1_089,<NAME_FRO>: There are things I'd never have obtained!

FLD_MEST1_093,<NAME_MAG>: Your skill with the Masamune is that great\already?
FLD_MEST1_094,<NAME_MAR>: What's that?
FLD_MEST1_095,<NAME_LUC>: What's happening?
FLD_MEST1_096,<NAME_ROB>: Large-scale energy reaction detected!
FLD_MEST1_097,<NAME_FRO>: Could it be Lavos?
FLD_MEST1_098,<NAME_MAG>: No!\He mustn't awaken from his slumber yet!
FLD_MEST1_099,<NAME_MAR>: Awaken?\You just created him, didn't you?
FLD_MEST1_100,<NAME_LUC>: What do you mean?\Didn't you create him?
FLD_MEST1_101,<NAME_ROB>: Awaken? I do not understand.\According to the records, Lavos was created here,\at this precise moment.
FLD_MEST1_102,<NAME_MAG>: You fools!\I but summoned him!<PAGE>\He has dwelt within the earth for aeons, absorbing\the land's energy and growing ever stronger!
FLD_MEST1_103,<NAME_MAR>: What?
FLD_MEST1_104,<NAME_LUC>: Then, he wasn't born in this age.
FLD_MEST1_105,<NAME_ROB>: It appears my data was incorrect.
FLD_MEST1_106,<NAME_FRO>: What is this energy in the air?
FLD_MEST1_107,<NAME_MAR>: A Gate?
FLD_MEST1_108,<NAME_LUC>: A Gate!?\And a huge one, too!
FLD_MEST1_109,<NAME_ROB>: I am detecting the emergence of a Gate of\theoretically improbable proportions!
FLD_MEST1_110,<NAME_MAG>: You!\If you had not interfered...!
FLD_MEST1_111,<NAME_MAR>: <NAME_CRO>!
FLD_MEST1_112,<NAME_LUC>: We're being drawn in!
FLD_MEST1_113,<NAME_ROB>: An enormous gravity sink is forming!

FLD_MEST1_134,<NAME_MAG>: Ah, the Masamune...<WAIT>0c</WAIT><AUTO_PAGE>\Very well.<WAIT>06</WAIT><AUTO_END>
FLD_MEST1_135,What're you lookin' at?<PAGE>\Me? I'm Spekkio, the Master of War!\I watch all kinds of battles from here.
FLD_MEST1_136,Spekkio: How do I look to you?\<S10><S10><C1>Strong!</C1>\<S10><S10><C2>Weak!</C2>
FLD_MEST1_137,Spekkio: I see.\How I look depends on how strong you are.\If you're strong, I look strong.\If you're weak, I look weak.
FLD_MEST1_138,Spekkio: Hm?<PAGE>\Oh, you've got it in you, don't you?\That must be why the old guy let you through.<PAGE>\See, a long, long time before you were born,\there was a kingdom where magic flourished.\Everyone there could use it!<PAGE>\But the people abused their powers, and ended\up destroyin' the place. After that, there wasn't\anyone left who could use magic—well, exceptin'\fiends, of course.<PAGE>\But you have it! That inner strength, I mean.\Magic needs power of the heart.\That's where it flows from.<PAGE>\There're four types of magic: fire, water, light,\and shadow. Not everyone's got the same type.
FLD_MEST1_139,Spekkio: You, with the punk hairdo!\You've got light.
FLD_MEST1_140,Spekkio: The gal with the ponytail has the power of\water.
FLD_MEST1_141,Spekkio: That girl with the goofy glasses...\Her power is fire.
FLD_MEST1_142,Spekkio: What's with this big clunky thing?\Sorry, buddy. But, well...you aren't alive.<PAGE>\You've got great inner strength, for what it's worth.\It's just...you aren't descended from the ancient magic\users, so you're never goin' to be able to cast spells.<PAGE>\Your laser weapons and whatnot should suffice, though.\They can inflict shadow damage, kind of like shadow\magic.
FLD_MEST1_143,Spekkio: By the way, it's not just magic—everything\is made up of those four elements.
FLD_MEST1_144,Spekkio: All right. Starting from the door, circle\clockwise along the walls of my room three times\and say "I want to use magic!" over and over in\your head.<PAGE>\Don't lose track, now. Three times!\Don't want you churnin' yourselves into butter.
FLD_MEST1_145,Spekkio: No cheatin'!\I've got my eye on you!<PAGE>\Do it over! From the door, clockwise along the wall,\three times!
FLD_MEST1_146,Spekkio: Well done!

FLD_MEST1_156,Spekkio: Oh me, oh my...<PAGE>\That was embarrassing.
FLD_MEST1_157,Spekkio: There must have been some mistake!\I'm the Master of War!<PAGE>\Oh yeah, it's 'cause I taught you magic!\Yeah, that's why you won!

FLD_MEST1_164,<CT>\<NAME_FRO> learned to use magic!
FLD_MEST1_165,Spekkio: Hey there, sweetheart!<PAGE>\Unfortunately, you were born before magic existed,\so casting spells is right out. But if it's any\consolation, you seem to have plenty of other assets.\Ahem.

FLD_MEST1_168,Spekkio: Hey, that spiky-haired fellow hasn't\been coming around lately.
