FLD_MSG04_000,Leene: Cyrus...\You're leaving, aren't you?
FLD_MSG04_001,Cyrus: I am. It's long past time we reclaimed the Badge\from the Frog King.<PAGE>\And I need to see that sword with my own eyes.
FLD_MSG04_002,King: Cyrus, this kingdom has need of you.<PAGE>\Leene and I need you as well.\See that you return.
FLD_MSG04_003,Cyrus: As long as there is life in these bones,\I shall—come what may.<PAGE>\Well then, by your leave...
FLD_MSG04_004,Knights: Sir Cyrus!
FLD_MSG04_005,Knight: On behalf of the knighthood,\we wish you a safe journey and Godspeed.
FLD_MSG04_006,Cyrus: My brothers...
FLD_MSG04_007,Cyrus: I trust the kingdom's protection to you.\See that she is kept safe from her enemies.
FLD_MSG04_008,Cyrus: Pardon the delay.\Let us be on our way.
FLD_MSG04_009,Leene: Glenn, you be careful, too!
FLD_MSG04_010,Glenn: Be well, Your Majesty!
FLD_MSG04_011,So! You seek the Hero's Badge, knight of the kingdom\of men? Come and take it, then—if you can!\CROAK!
FLD_MSG04_012,Cyrus: That is what I mean to do.<PAGE>\Nirvana Strike!
FLD_MSG04_013,GRAAAACK!\I... I'm beaten!<PAGE>\Pfft! Filthy badge!\Do not think I'll forget this!
FLD_MSG04_014,Child: I'm the wind!\Whoosh!
FLD_MSG04_015,Child: Hey, don't go up there!
FLD_MSG04_016,Child: Did you come to take it?\The Masamune, I mean.\<S10><S10><C1>Yes.</C1>\<S10><S10><C2>No.</C2>
FLD_MSG04_017,Child: You didn't?\You should hurry up and leave, then.
FLD_MSG04_018,Child: I thought so.\Wait just a second, all right?
FLD_MSG04_019,Child: Oh Big Brother...\Where are you, Masa?
FLD_MSG04_020,Masa: What is it, Mune?
FLD_MSG04_021,Masa: Not again!
FLD_MSG04_022,Masa: So, thought you'd make a name for yourself\as Hero by grabbing the Masamune, did you?\What a buffoon!
FLD_MSG04_023,Mune: Humans are all the same, aren't they?\It's how you use the sword that's important,\not just that you have the strongest one!
FLD_MSG04_024,Masa: You can't even understand something as simple\as that. Guess that proves you're human.
FLD_MSG04_025,Mune: What should we do?
FLD_MSG04_026,Masa: The usual—test them.\Might as well give them the chance\to entertain us for awhile.
FLD_MSG04_027,Mune: All right!\Here we go!\Whoooosh!
FLD_MSG04_028,Mune: Hey, Masa, these ones are pretty tough.
FLD_MSG04_029,Masa: No one's lasted this long since Cyrus.
FLD_MSG04_030,Masa: We fight them for real, of course!
FLD_MSG04_031,Mune: All right, this is it!<PAGE>\Masa: No more games!
FLD_MSG04_032,With Masa's bravery...
FLD_MSG04_033,And Mune's brains...
FLD_MSG04_034,We're unstoppable!
FLD_MSG04_035,Mune: They beat us, Masa.
FLD_MSG04_036,Masa: That was fun!
FLD_MSG04_037,Mune: Do you think they'll fix us?<PAGE>\Will they find our proper owner?
FLD_MSG04_038,Masa: Yes, it'll be all right.
FLD_MSG04_039,Mune: Good luck to you.
FLD_MSG04_040,Masa: Allow me!\We'll ride the wind to the base of the mountain!
FLD_MSG04_041,<NAME_LUC>: So this is the Masamune.<PAGE>\It looks like it's been broken for ages.
FLD_MSG04_042,<NAME_ROB>: This sword is the legendary Masamune.<PAGE>\Its appearance would indicate that a great\deal of time has passed since it was broken.
FLD_MSG04_043,<CT>\Obtained the broken Masamune!
FLD_MSG04_044,Ride the wind?\<S10><S10><C1>Yes.</C1>\<S10><S10><C2>No.</C2>

FLD_MSG04_054,Get 'em!
FLD_MSG04_055,*belch*\Hmm? What's with the disguises?<PAGE>\Hurry up and change!\No need to be walking around like humans in here.
FLD_MSG04_056,Ugh, it's almost time for my shift.\I hate pretending to be human!\They're so smelly and repulsive.\It's demeaning! *burp*
FLD_MSG04_057,All right, think I'll pay my respects to the\Fiendlord's statue before my shift starts.
FLD_MSG04_058,Those ones we ate last time weren't so bad.\And those two soldiers we just caught look\plump and juicy. Hee hee hee...
FLD_MSG04_059,Yakra's a genius!\His plan to imprison the Chancellor and\take on his role worked like magic!<PAGE>\Now the Queen's ours, and the castle's in an uproar.\This is rich!
